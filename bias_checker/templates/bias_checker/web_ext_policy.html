  <h1>Privacy Policy for Gender Bias Checker Web Extension</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    At <strong>Gender Bias Checker</strong>, we are committed to protecting your
    privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how our Chrome web extension collects,
    uses, and protects any information when you use our service.
  </p>

  <h2>Information</h2>
  <p>
    <strong
      >We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user
      data.</strong
    >
    The Gender Bias Checker extension operates entirely
    <strong>locally</strong> within your browser. All text processing occurs on
    your device and is not sent to any external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The extension scans <strong>only the text you type</strong> into input
      fields and <code>contenteditable</code> elements on webpages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gender-biased words are detected based on a predefined local dictionary.
    </li>
    <li>Suggestions for inclusive alternatives are displayed in real time.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>No text data is collected, logged, or transmitted</strong> outside
      of your browser.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions Justification</h2>
  <p>
    To function as intended, the extension requests the following permissions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>tabs</strong>: To determine when a new page is loaded and activate
      scanning.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>scripting</strong>: To inject scripts into active webpages for
      monitoring user text input.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>host_permissions</strong> (e.g., <code>"&lt;all_urls&gt;"</code>):
      To enable functionality on any webpage where users may enter text.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These permissions are used
    <strong
      >solely for the purpose of enabling real-time detection and
      suggestions</strong
    >
    and are not used for tracking or data harvesting.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not share, sell, or transfer</strong> any information to third
    parties, because we do not collect any.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    This extension does <strong>not</strong> use any third-party analytics
    tools, advertising networks, or remote servers. Everything happens locally
    in your browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted
    on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage users to review
    the policy periodically.
